## Intro

Walnut Admin is an open-source and continuously optimized back-office management system template. The project focuses on the front end. The back end and database have a certain scale but are not well-structured. It is still in the development stage. The technology stack includes `Vue3`, `Vite4`, `NaiveUI`, `TypeScript`, `VueUse`, `pnpm`, `unocss`, etc., which is suitable for learning and communication!

To run the project, you need the [backend][walnut-admin-server], which is a monolithic application framework of [NestJS][nestjs-url]. The database used is [MongoDB][mongodb-url]. For more information, please refer to the [documentation][walnut-admin-doc].

## NOTICE

The domain name of the project preview address will not change. The server will be redeployed soon. Stay tuned!
